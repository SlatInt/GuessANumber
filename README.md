# GuessANumber
A simple game of guessing random numbers from set range 1 to 20.
There is no way of losing here, the idea is to get the highest score possible.
Numbers of points for finding a number is set to 4 and for missing to -1, so it's really hard to stay at 0 points (by using binary search ie.).

Based on Jonas Schmedtmann idea and design from Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course: From Zero to Expert!".
